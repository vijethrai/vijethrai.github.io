Protheses can vastly improve quality of life for people with amputation. A big challenge in prosthetic control, however, is conveying the user intent - connecting the mind and the machine. 

Center of Bionic Medicine, under Dr Todd Kuiken, pioneered myo-electric control of prosthetic limbs. Using muscle signals as the interface, the next generation prostheses are directly controlled by the user. As a research engineer, I conceptualized and designed controllers, EMG acquisition systems; provided hardware support to prosthetists and researchers for OttoBock Hand, BiOMAnkle, VanderbiltLeg.
