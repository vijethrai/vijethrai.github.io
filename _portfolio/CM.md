Lower limb amputation can be a huge impediment, not just for ones's mobility, but overall well-being. Prostheses alleviate the challenges but controlling a robotic limb in a intuitive way can be a challenge in its own. Current powered legs are mostly well suited for simple rhythmic tasks like flatground walking. 

Coordinated Movement is a new data-driven paradigm using whole-body coordination and examples of real-world movements for prosthesis control. It can very easiy handle complex and non-rhythmic real-world movements (like obstacle crossing). It is also a continuous control without explicit & awkward transition mechanisms to switch from one type of movement to another.
