Powered limbs are better, lighter and more capable than ever. But with great powers comes great need for controllablility. In absence of good control, users still prefer passive limbs for their simplicity. Passive limbs are ill-equpped to handle complex terrains, induces an asymmetric gait resulting in stress to hip and back joints. 


Open Source Leg is a low-cost prosthetic limb developed by Univ of Michigan to faciliate control research. In collaboration with the Univ of Michigan, we developed a real-time controller to realize our Coordinated Movement Control. Live kinematics were input to a pre-trained neural network to generate refernce trajectory to actuate the prosthetic knee joint.
