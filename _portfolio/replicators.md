The REPLICATOR project, funded by the European Commission, focuses on the development of an advanced robotic system, consisting of a super-large-scale swarm of small autonomous mobile micro-robots that are capable of self-assembling into large artificial organisms.  They will be used to build autonomous sensor networks, capable of self-spreading and self-maintaining in open-ended and hazardous environments.
  
#### Role 
 As a research intern at Almende B.V, in collaboration with 9 other universities across European Union, I investigated decentralized algorithms for assembling and metamorphosizing modular robots. Using Graph Grammar I was able to successfully assemble linear structures like snakes and complex organisms like a hexapod without any human intervention.
