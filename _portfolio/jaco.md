People with motor impairments are often unable to operate the assistive devices that could improve their quality of life. Robotics and machine learning can offer a chance to share the burden. 

As a research engineer at Argall Lab at Rehabiliation Institute of Chicago (now Shirley Ryan Ability Lab), I supported software and hardware development of semi-autonomous assistive devices - JACO assistive robotic arms and smart wheelchair.
